Disassembler Library for ARM

Disassembles ARM instructions to a data structure that makes it easy to access
instruction parameters. The library also contains functions to print
human-readable assembly code from instructions, and alongside the library
a small disassembly tool is provided. Tested on ARMv4 code but should support
instructions in ARMv5 and below. Thumb instructions are currently not
supported.

Compiling and installing:
First, run the following command if you branched the code from
the bzr repository:
 $ ./bootstrap

Next, use the following steps to compile libdisarm:
 $ ./configure
 $ make

If it succeded you should be able to run dacli directly from
the build directory like this:
 $ ./dacli -h

If you want to install (probably requires that you are root) run
the following command:
 $ make install

Please see the web sites mentioned above for further information.
